# ==============================

"""
- In Python, every module has a built-in variable called __name__.
- When a Python script is run directly, __name__ is set to "__main__".
- When a script is imported as a module, __name__ is set to the module's name.
- This allows you to control code execution (e.g., only run main code if not imported).
